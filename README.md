# Development-of-tactile-sensors
FURP 2024 Summer

This project is aiming at creating advanced haptic sensing technologies that can endow robots with the ability to perceive and interpret a wide range of tactile stimuli. This initiative focuses on enhancing the touch sensitivity of robots to enable them to perform delicate tasks, such as manipulating fragile objects, conducting medical procedures, or navigating through environments that require a gentle touch. By integrating state-of-the-art materials, sensor designs, and signal processing algorithms, this project aims to bridge the gap between robotic and human tactile capabilities.

This project is an extension of our existing fyp and furp projects, aiming to further advance the development of deformation-aware tactile sensors and remote tactile sensors.
